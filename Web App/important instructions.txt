FAKE NEWS DETECTOR APPLICATION
Setup and Usage Instructions
============================================================

This guide will walk you through the complete process of setting up and using the Fake News Detector web application.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system
- pip (Python package manager)
- Basic command line knowledge

STEP 1: VERIFY APPLICATION FILE STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------
Make sure your project folder has the following structure:

Web app/
├── web.py
├── important instructions.txt
├── requirements.txt
├── fake_news_model.joblib
├── fake_news_vectorizer.joblib
├── static/
│   └── style.css
└── templates/
    └── index.html

Important: The HTML and CSS files should already be in their correct folders.
Do not move them - they need to stay in the templates/ and static/ folders respectively.

STEP 2: INSTALL PYTHON DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------------------
You have two options to install the required libraries:

OPTION A: Install from requirements.txt (Recommended)
1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   cd path/to/your/project/folder

3. Install all packages at once:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

OPTION B: Install each library individually
If you prefer to install packages one by one, run these commands:

1. Install Flask (web framework):
   pip install flask

2. Install scikit-learn (machine learning):
   pip install scikit-learn

3. Install joblib (model saving/loading):
   pip install joblib

4. Install numpy (numerical computations):
   pip install numpy

5. Install nltk (natural language processing):
   pip install nltk

STEP 3: DOWNLOAD NLTK DATA (REQUIRED FOR TEXT PROCESSING)
---------------------------------------------------------
The application needs additional data for text processing. Follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. Start Python by typing:
   python

3. In the Python interpreter, run these commands one by one:
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   nltk.download('omw-1.4')

4. Exit the Python interpreter by typing:
   exit()

STEP 4: RUN THE APPLICATION
---------------------------
1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   cd path/to/your/project/folder

3. Run the Flask application:
   python web.py

4. You should see output similar to:
   * Serving Flask app 'web'
   * Debug mode: on
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

5. Open your web browser and go to:
   http://localhost:5000

STEP 5: USING THE APPLICATION
-----------------------------
1. In the text area, paste or type the news article you want to check
2. Click the "Analyze News" button
3. Wait for the analysis to complete (usually a few seconds)
4. View the results:
   - The prediction will show either "True" or "Fake"
   - The confidence percentage shows how confident the model is
   - A brief explanation will provide context for the result

5. To analyze another news article, simply replace the text and click the button again

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
-----------------------------
1. If you get a "Model not loaded" error:
   - Check that fake_news_model.joblib and fake_news_vectorizer.joblib are in the main folder
   - Ensure the files are not corrupted

2. If you get NLTK errors:
   - Make sure you downloaded the NLTK data as described in Step 3

3. If the app doesn't start:
   - Check that all packages are installed correctly
   - Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed

4. If predictions seem incorrect:
   - The model might be biased or need retraining
   - This is a demonstration tool and may not be 100% accurate

SUPPORT
-------
If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all files are in the correct locations
2. Verify all Python packages are installed correctly
3. Ensure your system meets the prerequisites

For additional help, consult the Flask documentation or Python machine learning resources.
